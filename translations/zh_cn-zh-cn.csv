JWK-FM-Appearance-Intro,Appearance reflects how your character is perceived by others and depends on all worn attire and held items. Wearing any piece of military clothing will cause your character to be identified as a <b>combatant</b>. This means enemies will shoot on sight and mark you as wanted — the same applies to openly carrying any type of weapon.,外观反映了你的角色在他人眼中的形象，取决于所穿戴的所有服装和携带的物品。穿任何军用服装都会导致你的角色被识别为<b>战斗人员</b>。这意味着敌人会见即射并将你标记为通缉——公开携带任何类型武器也同样适用。,
JWK-FM-Appearance-Settings,"Depending on your difficulty settings, you may see a status icon denoting whether your character is perceived as a combatant.<br/><br/>As the base game does not contain any civilian backpacks, the general purpose military ones are not treated as military equipment.<br/><br/>The absence of a shirt, pants, or boots will cause your character to attract enemy attention. After all, someone running around in only their underwear is bound to look suspicious.",根据你的难度设置，你可能会看到一个状态图标，表示你的角色是否被视为战斗人员。<br/><br/>由于基础游戏中没有民用背包，一般用途的军用背包不被视为军用装备。<br/><br/>缺少衬衫、裤子或靴子会引起敌人注意。毕竟，光着内衣乱跑的人肯定会显得可疑。,
JWK-FM-Armories-Intro,"Armories allow to purchase weapons and ammunitions using resources stored at the base.<br/><br/>Different types of armories can be built, depending on the operating base type:<br/><br/>- <b>Allied armory</b> is available at <b>military bases</b> and offers weapons and ammunitions of your supporting faction.<br/><br/>- <b>Field armory</b> is available at <b>FOBs</b> and offers weapons and ammunitions of the player faction.",军械库允许使用基地储存的资源购买武器和弹药。<br/><br/>可根据作战基地类型建造不同类型的军械库：<br/><br/>- <b>盟军军械库</b>：可在<b>军事基地</b>建造，提供你所属盟军阵营的武器和弹药。<br/><br/>- <b>野战军械库</b>：可在<b>前线作战基地（FOB）</b>建造，提供玩家阵营的武器和弹药。,
JWK-FM-Battles-Intro,"Battles occur when control over a certain point of interest is contested. When a battle is won, the contesting faction takes control. Refer to the specific location description to learn how to provoke a battle. Only one battle can be active at any given moment and it's progress cannot be saved. If the game is closed during a battle, the battle will need to be started from the beginning. Battles length and intensity depend on the number of players online, campaign progress, location significance and threat level.<br/><br/>Once a battle begins, everyone will see a notification. Progress bar will appear at the top of the screen, accompanied by the location name. Battle location will be also marked on the map, denoting the <b>contested area</b> by a stripe pattern.",当某个关键点的控制权受到争夺时，会发生战斗.战斗胜利后，争夺方将获得控制权。请参考具体地点说明了解如何触发战斗。每次只能有一场战斗进行，且其进度无法保存。如果游戏在战斗过程中关闭，则需从头开始战斗。战斗的持续时间和强度取决于在线玩家数量、战役进度、地点重要性和威胁等级。<br/><br/>一旦战斗开始，所有玩家都会收到通知。屏幕顶部会出现进度条，并显示地点名称。战斗地点也会在地图上标记，争夺区域用条纹表示。,
JWK-FM-Battles-Phases,"Each battle consists of two phases:<br/><br/>- <b>deployment phase</b>: the enemy is still deploying onto the battlefield. The progress bar is yellow and represents how much of their forces are already fielded. Once the bar completes, the battle will transition into domination phase.<br/><br/>- <b>domination phase</b>: the sides fight for control. The progress bar is green and represents resistance control over the location. The control will increase every few moments if there are more <b>freedom fighters</b> in the <b>contested area</b> than enemies in the near vicinity.<br/><br/>If there are no <b>freedom fighters</b> in the contested area, the resistance will begin to rapidly lose control. In this case, the progress bar will turn red. Once the bar fills, the battle will be lost.",每场战斗分为两个阶段：<br/><br/>- <b>部署阶段</b>：敌军仍在部署到战场。进度条为黄色，显示敌军已部署力量的比例。进度条完成后，战斗将进入控制阶段。<br/><br/>- <b>控制阶段</b>：双方争夺控制权。进度条为绿色，表示抵抗力量对该地点的控制程度。如果<b>自由战士</b>数量超过附近敌军数量，控制权会每隔一段时间增加。<br/><br/>如果争夺区域内没有<b>自由战士</b>，抵抗力量将迅速失去控制权，此时进度条会变为红色，一旦填满，战斗将失败。,
JWK-FM-BeingWanted-Heat,"<b>Heat level</b> is a measure of how much your character is wanted by the enemy. Once it drops to 0, you will be no longer wanted. Heat decreases over time as long as you stay out of sight of enemy troops. Your current heat level is represented by the fill level of the wanted status icon in the HUD. The time required to fully lose maximum heat depends on your difficulty settings.<br/><br/>If your character dies, the heat level and wanted state does not transfer to your new character.",<b>通缉值（Heat level）</b>衡量你的角色被敌人通缉的程度。通缉值降至0时，你将不再被通缉。只要你保持在敌军视线之外，通缉值会随时间下降。当前通缉值在HUD中的通缉状态图标填充比例中显示。完全消除最大通缉值所需时间取决于你的难度设置。<br/><br/>如果你的角色死亡，通缉值和通缉状态不会转移到新角色。,
JWK-FM-BeingWanted-Intro,"Various activities may cause your character to become <b>wanted</b>. This means your character is actively hunted by enemy forces and will be shot on sight, even if you appear as a civilian. Being wanted has also many negative side effects, such as:<br/><br/>- civilian shops will not serve you<br/>- resistance representatives may not want to talk to you<br/>- public transport becomes unavailable<br/>- resting becomes unavailable<br/><br/>...and more.",多种行为可能导致你的角色被标记为<b>通缉</b>。这意味着敌军会主动追捕你，即使你看起来是平民，也会被见即射。被通缉还会带来许多负面影响，例如：<br/><br/>- 民用商店不会为你提供服务<br/>- 抵抗组织代表可能不愿与你交谈<br/>- 无法使用公共交通<br/>- 无法进行休息<br/><br/>……以及更多其他限制。,

JWK-FM-CharacterStatus-Heat,"Visible if your character is <b>wanted</b>. Its fill level represents how much <b>heat</b> your character has, which reduces over time as you remain hidden.",如果角色被<b>通缉</b>，此图标可见。填充量表示<b>热度</b>，随着隐蔽时间增加而减少。,

JWK-FM-CharacterStatus-SeenDetected,"Visible if your character has been detected as a threat and is within enemy sight. If you are at a distance, concealed or in the dark, it will take longer for the enemies to recognize you. When this happens, the icon will gradually fill up, giving you a brief chance to hide.",角色被识别为威胁且在敌人视线内时可见。若在远处、隐蔽或黑暗中，敌人识别较慢。此时图标会逐渐填充，给你短暂的躲藏机会。,
JWK-FM-CharacterStatus-Undercover,"Visible if your character is <b>undercover</b>, which means it's impersonating an enemy soldier.",角色为<b>卧底</b>时可见，即假扮敌军士兵。,
JWK-FM-CiviliansOverview-GameProgress,"Population support is required indirectly to finish the campaign. Without it, you won't be able to control all required points of interest. It counts towards the progress, so you need to convince every single person to reach 100%.",民众支持是完成战役的间接需求。没有它，你无法控制所有关键点。它计入进度，因此需说服每个人达到100%。,
JWK-FM-CiviliansOverview-Income,Each supporter will donate a small amount of money to the resistance every day. The funds are then split equally and sent to all present <b>freedom fighters</b> automatically.,每个支持者每天都会向抵抗组织捐赠少量资金。这些资金会被自动平分并分配给所有在场的<b>自由战士</b>。,
JWK-FM-CiviliansOverview-Intro,"Civilian population is a key element in your revolution. After all, it is their freedom you are fighting for. Just incidentally they also happen to fuel your efforts with money and manpower. Each civilian may have one of the following stances regarding revolution:<br/><br/>- <b>supporting</b>: friendly to the resistance members and disapproving of the occupier.<br/><br/>- <b>neutral</b>: no stance, the initial state for most of the population. They don't really care about the revolution or the occupier forces. They can be turned into supporters, given enough reasons to.<br/><br/>- <b>hostile</b>: actively against the revolution and supporting the occupier. They cannot be turned into supporters, but given enough time they may become neutral.<br/><br/>Population moods will change in reaction to your actions. While civilians are rather tolerant to acts of war and inconveniences caused by combat against the occupier, any wrongdoings towards them will turn them hostile very quickly. Keep in mind your supporters may become hostile just as well, negating your hard-earned friendliness.<br/><br/>You can inspect general population stats in the campaign progress menu. To check local trends, inspect selected town on the map. Population composition is represented by a progress bar, with color-coded segments proportional to the popularity of relevant stance.",平民人口是你革命中的关键因素。毕竟，你所争取的是他们的自由。顺便说一下，他们也会通过资金和人力支持你的行动。每个平民在革命中可能持有以下立场之一：<br/><br/>- <b>支持</b>：对抵抗组织成员友好，反对占领者。<br/><br/>- <b>中立</b>：没有明确立场，这是大多数人口的初始状态。他们对革命或占领军并不关心。只要有足够理由，他们可以被转变为支持者。<br/><br/>- <b>敌对</b>：积极反对革命并支持占领者。他们无法被转变为支持者，但随着时间推移，他们可能变为中立。<br/><br/>人口情绪会根据你的行动发生变化。虽然平民对战争行为和针对占领者的战斗所带来的不便相对宽容，但任何对他们的不当行为都会迅速使他们变得敌对。请记住，你的支持者也可能变为敌对，从而抵消你辛苦争取的友好度。<br/><br/>你可以在“战役进度”菜单中查看整体人口统计。要查看本地趋势，可在地图上检查选定城镇。人口构成用进度条表示，条形颜色与相关立场的受欢迎程度成比例。,
JWK-FM-Commanding-Intro,"You can command a squad using the vanilla commanding system. You subordinates are persistent and in multiplayer sessions enter and exit the game with you. If your character dies, your squad will become detached. Any player, including you, can take command over a detached fighter by approaching them and using an action. Therefore you can regain command, if you return to your former squad with a new character quickly enough. A detached squad will disappear if there is no one nearby for a certain time.",你可以使用原版指挥系统来指挥一个小队。你的小队成员是持续存在的，在多人游戏中会随你进出游戏。如果你的角色死亡，小队将变为脱离状态。任何玩家，包括你自己，都可以通过靠近脱离的小队成员并使用动作来重新接管指挥。因此，如果你足够快地使用新角色返回原小队，你可以重新获得指挥权。如果一定时间内周围没有玩家，脱离的小队将会消失。,
JWK-FM-Construction-Building,"Buildable structures cost resources, which are taken from the location storage. <b>Right now raised structures cannot be moved or removed.</b> Structures belong to the resistance in general and are not linked to the specific person constructing them.",可建造的结构需要消耗资源，这些资源来自该地点的储存。<b>目前建造的结构无法移动或拆除。</b>结构属于抵抗组织整体，而不是与建造者个人关联。,
JWK-FM-Construction-Intro,"Construction includes placement of various items in the world and building structures. Both these actions are available via <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> <b>radial menu</b>, but will only appear if your character is equipped with an <b>entrenching tool</b>. Moreover, construction is only possible at <b>operating bases</b> controlled by the resistance.","建造包括在世界中放置各种物品以及建造结构。这两种操作都可以通过 <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> <b>环形菜单</b> 进行，但只有当你的角色装备了<b>战壕铲</b>时才会显示。此外，建造仅能在抵抗组织控制的<b>作战基地</b>进行。",
JWK-FM-Construction-Placement,"Placeable objects are smaller props that are paid for in money by the placing person. If an item can be owned, it will be automatically linked to the person placing it (for example: item storages). <b>Right now placed items cannot be moved or removed.</b>",可放置的物品是较小的道具，由放置者用金钱支付。如果物品可以被拥有，它将自动与放置者绑定（例如：物品储存箱）。<b>目前放置的物品无法移动或移除。</b>,
JWK-FM-DifficultySettings-Intro,"When starting a new game, you can modify various settings to adjust the difficulty and mechanics to your play style. Although these are collectively called difficulty settings, some of the choices are rather a matter of preference. Right now those settings can only be adjusted when starting a new campaign.",在开始新游戏时，你可以修改各种设置，以调整难度和游戏机制以符合你的玩法风格。虽然这些设置统称为难度设置，但其中一些选择更多是个人偏好。目前，这些设置只能在开启新战役时进行调整。,
JWK-FM-DifficultySettings-Presets,"You can quickly change all settings by selecting one of the predefined presets. Selecting a preset does not prevent you from adjusting the settings further - if you change any of the options, the preset selector will automatically switch to <b>Custom</b>, retaining all other settings from the preset. This way you can use any of the presets as a starting point.<br/><br/>If this is your first playthrough, we recommend using <b>Normal</b> preset to experience a balanced gameplay the way it was envisioned.",你可以通过选择预设方案快速更改所有设置。选择预设不会阻止你进一步调整设置——如果你更改了其中的任何选项，预设选择器将自动切换为<b>自定义</b>，并保留该预设中的其他所有设置。这样，你就可以将任意预设作为起点进行游戏调整。<br/><br/>如果这是你的首次游玩，我们推荐使用<b>普通</b>预设，以体验设计者设想的平衡玩法。,
JWK-FM-DonatingSupplies-Intro,"Free stuff is an excellent method to gain supporters, whether you are a politician, or... a politician-to-be. If you win the revolution, of course. The downside is that you actually have to bring the stuff to the table. But here comes the good news - when it's free, nobody will ask you how you got it.<br/><br/>Donating supplies is a rather expensive method, unless you have a surplus of your own production. Supplies are also vital to your own operations, so giving them away in the early stages of the revolution may not be the best choice.<br/><br/>There is no limit as to how many supplies and how often you can donate to a specific town, but many donations over a short period of time will stop having an effect on the support. It's best to diversify and distribute the supplies evenly to many towns in a concurrent manner. Donation effects wear out after some time, so you can come back and donate another shipment later.<br/><br/>Load your vehicle with supplies and drive to the exact location of the town marker, as shown on your map. Come to a full stop once you are within 50 meters from the marker. A prompt should appear, and the donation option will be available in the radial menu.",免费物资是获得支持者的绝佳方式，无论你是政治家，还是……准政治家。当然，前提是你赢得了革命。缺点是，你必须亲自把物资送到受益方手中。不过好消息是——当物资是免费的，没人会问你是怎么得到的。<br/><br/>捐赠物资是一种相当昂贵的方式，除非你自身有多余的产出。物资对你自己的行动也至关重要，因此在革命初期随意赠送可能不是最佳选择。<br/><br/>你向特定城镇捐赠的物资数量和频率没有限制，但在短时间内多次捐赠将不再有效。最好采取分散策略，将物资均匀分配到多个城镇。<br/><br/>捐赠效果会随时间消退，因此你可以在稍后再次捐赠另一批物资。<br/><br/>将车辆装满物资，驱车前往地图上显示的城镇标记的准确位置。当你距离标记50米以内时，车辆应完全停稳。此时将弹出提示，捐赠选项会出现在<b>环形菜单</b>中。,

JWK-FM-EquipmentStores-Intro,"Equipment stores allow to purchase uniforms and non-lethal equipment using resources stored at the base.<br/><br/>Different types of stores can be built, depending on the operating base type:<br/><br/>- <b>Allied equipment store</b> is available at <b>military bases</b> and offers equipment of your supporting faction.<br/><br/>- <b>Field equipment store</b> is available at <b>FOBs</b> and offers equipment of the player faction.",装备商店允许使用基地储存的资源购买制服和非致命装备。<br/><br/>可以建造不同类型的商店，具体取决于操作基地类型：<br/><br/>- <b>盟军装备商店</b> 可在 <b>军事基地</b> 使用，提供你的支持阵营的装备。<br/><br/>- <b>前线装备商店</b> 可在 <b>前线作战基地（FOB）</b> 使用，提供玩家阵营的装备。,
JWK-FM-Factories-Control,"Factories are usually guarded by a enemy forces garrison. Once the garrison is cleared and the area is secured, a battle will follow. Be careful, as during factory working hours civilian workers will be present in the factory area. After repelling enemy forces the resistance will take control over the factory. All factories must be controlled by the resistance in order to achieve victory.",工厂通常由敌军驻军守卫。一旦清除驻军并确保区域安全，将会发生战斗。请注意，工厂工作时间内会有平民工人在场。在击退敌军后，抵抗组织将接管工厂。所有工厂必须由抵抗组织控制才能取得胜利。,
JWK-FM-Factories-Intro,"Factories are crucial for your revolution, as they can provide a steady stream of resources, which are much needed for any war efforts.",工厂对你的革命至关重要，因为它们可以提供稳定的资源流，这对于任何战争行动都非常必要。,
JWK-FM-Factories-ResourceProduction,"Each factory controlled by the resistance will produce certain resources, depending on the factory type. Those resources may be then freely utilized by freedom fighters as deemed fit. On each factory area there is at least one resource storage, in which the produced resources are placed. Those storages are always marked on the map and feature a sign.",每座由抵抗组织控制的工厂会根据工厂类型生产特定资源。这些资源随后可由自由战士自由使用。在每个工厂区域至少有一个资源储存点，用于存放生产的资源。这些储存点始终在地图上标记，并配有标识。,
JWK-FM-FastTravel-Intro,"Fast travel is available only to player controlled operating bases. It is more expensive than public transport, but it can be performed from any location, even far away from roads and infrastructure. You cannot fast travel while being wanted, but you don't have to appear as a civilian.<br/><br/>To use fast travel, you need to open your map and select fast travel icon from the tool picker in the upper-left corner of the screen.",快速旅行仅适用于玩家控制的操作基地。它比公共交通更昂贵，但可以从任何地点进行，即使远离道路和基础设施。被通缉时无法使用快速旅行，但无需以平民身份出现。<br/><br/>要使用快速旅行，你需要打开地图，并在屏幕左上角的工具选择器中选择快速旅行图标。,
JWK-FM-FriendlyFighters-Intro,"Friendly fighters are resistance members or supporting civilians that decided to take part in the fight. They will appear during <b>battles</b> over various points of interest, such as towns, military bases, factories and others. They are autonomous and you cannot directly control them, but they will fight along side you with the enemy. However, their presence depends on your actions, as each fighter needs to be equipped with weapons and ammunition, and that in turn requires <b>supplies</b>.<br/><br/>Friendly fighters consume supplies stored at <b>hideouts</b>. If the location being fought for hosts a hideout - such as a town - then the fighters will appear and take supplies only from that specific hideout. Otherwise - when attacking factories or military bases - the supplies are consumed across all resistance hideouts, including the HQ. Supplies stored at resistance operating bases (FOBs, military bases) and controlled factories are not taken into account.",友军战士是抵抗组织成员或决定参与战斗的支持平民。他们会在各类兴趣点的 <b>战斗</b> 中出现，例如城镇、军事基地、工厂等。他们是自主行动的，你无法直接控制，但会与你并肩作战。然而，他们的出现取决于你的行动，因为每名战士都需要配备武器和弹药，而这又需要 <b>补给</b>。<br/><br/>友军战士消耗储存在 <b>据点</b> 的补给。如果争夺的地点设有据点——如城镇——战士将只从该据点获取补给。否则——在攻击工厂或军事基地时——补给将从所有抵抗据点（包括总部）中消耗。储存在抵抗操作基地（FOB、军事基地）和被控制工厂的补给不计入消耗。,

JWK-FM-Hideouts-HqHideouts,"HQ hideouts are established in safer locations — typically in remote houses away from densely populated areas or in small, secluded settlements. They serve as delivery and pickup points for various resistance operations and act as rally points where mercenary fighters can be <b>recruited</b>.<br/><br/>There is always one HQ hideout in the world. However, if you endanger it, it will cease operations and must be relocated. This process may take several hours, during which the HQ will be inaccessible. Any supplies stored there will be lost during the move, so take care to avoid triggering a relocation.<br/><br/>The HQ's location is not automatically revealed on your map. To discover its position, you must either call the HQ using a phone or contact it via radio, and then travel to the coordinates you are given.",HQ（总部）藏身点通常建立在较为安全的地点——通常是远离人口密集区的偏僻房屋或小型隐蔽定居点。它们作为各种抵抗行动的投递与接收点，同时也是佣兵战士可以<b>招募</b>的集结点。<br/><br/>世界上始终存在一个HQ藏身点。然而，如果你使其处于危险之中，它将停止运作并必须重新安置。这个过程可能需要数小时，在此期间HQ将无法访问。储存在其中的任何物资在搬迁过程中都会丢失，因此要小心避免触发重新安置。<br/><br/>HQ的位置不会自动显示在你的地图上。要发现其位置，你必须通过电话联系HQ或使用无线电联络，然后前往你所获得的坐标。,
JWK-FM-Hideouts-Intro,"Hideouts are secure locations used by the resistance for meetings and covert communication. At each hideout, you can meet a <b>resistance officer</b> - your primary contact for all conspiratorial matters. Speak with them to receive new assignments. Keep in mind that they’re not particularly fond of attracting attention from the authorities, so avoid visiting them when you have <b>heat</b> on you.<br/><br/> Hideout officers also offer guns, ammunition, and other war materials - all available in exchange for money.",藏身点是抵抗组织用于会议和秘密通讯的安全地点。在每个藏身点，你都可以见到一位<b>抵抗官员</b>——你处理所有阴谋事务的主要联系人。与他们交谈以接受新的任务。请记住，他们并不喜欢吸引当局注意，因此当你处于<b>追捕</b>状态时，避免访问他们。<br/><br/>藏身点官员还提供枪械、弹药及其他战争物资——所有物品均可用金钱交换获取。,
JWK-FM-Hideouts-TownHideouts,"The resistance will establish hideouts in towns and cities once there is enough local support to sustain its operations. Same goes the other way - if you lose too much support, resistance operations will become unsustainable and the hideout will be dissolved. Keeping a network of hideouts is very important, as each additional hideout means more storage space for supplies, which are used to arm your fighters during battles.",一旦在城镇和城市中获得足够的地方支持，抵抗组织将建立藏身点。反之亦然——如果你失去过多支持，抵抗行动将无法维持，藏身点将被解散。维持藏身点网络非常重要，因为每增加一个藏身点，就意味着更多的物资储存空间，这些物资用于在战斗中武装你的战士。,
JWK-FM-IllegalZones-Intro,"There are many areas that are forbidden to enter for civilians. Any players spotted in these areas will be instantly shot and hunted. Depending on your settings, these areas will be marked in red on your map and/or you will see a status icon on your HUD upon entering them. There is no need to frantically check your map as to not enter them by accident - they are usually fenced and accompany military bases, outposts, factories and other military or strategic points of interest.<br/><br/>Military personnel is allowed to be present within illegal zones. You can <b>disguise</b> yourself in enemy uniform to walk around freely.","许多区域对平民而言是禁止进入的。任何玩家一旦被发现进入这些区域,将会被立刻射击并追捕。根据你的设置,这些区域会在地图上以红色标记,/或在你进入时在 HUD 上显示状态图标。你不需要紧张地频繁查看地图以避免误入。这些区域通常有围栏,并伴随军事基地,哨所,工厂以及其他军事或战略要地。<br/><br/>军人被允许出现在非法区域中。你可以通过<b>伪装</b>成敌方制服来自由行动。",
JWK-FM-Introduction-Gameplay,"Primary design principle is to keep the gameplay immersive and demanding, while not being extremely punishing for the players. To capture entire map you will need to think strategically. Prepare well and pick your fights wisely, or you will end up in hopeless situations quickly. On the other hand, sudden death because of a stray bullet or unfortunate mortar strike will not set you back by hours of gameplay.<br/><br/>With this in mind, you can get the best out of this game mode by playing it with a chillsim / light role-play attitude.",核心设计原则是保持游戏沉浸感与挑战性，同时不会对玩家过于苛刻。要占领整个地图，你需要进行战略思考。充分准备并明智选择战斗，否则你很快会陷入绝境。另一方面，由于流弹或不幸的迫击炮袭击导致的突然死亡不会让你损失数小时的游戏时间。<br/><br/>基于此，你可以通过轻松模拟 / 轻度角色扮演的方式来获得该游戏模式的最佳体验。,
JWK-FM-Introduction-Intro,"Freedom Fighters is a persistent open-world campaign designed for single player and co-op gameplay. As players, you take control over <b>freedom fighters</b> and launch an uprising against occupier forces. Your goal is to liberate the whole map by taking control over multiple points of interests, both civilian and military.<br/><br/>Be sure to read through all sections of <b>Field Manual</b>, as this mod introduces multiple new mechanics to the game.",《自由战士》是一个持久开放世界的战役模式，适合单人和合作游戏。作为玩家，你将控制<b>自由战士</b>，对占领军发起起义。你的目标是通过控制多个民用和军事重点区域来解放整个地图。<br/><br/>务必阅读完整的<b>野外手册</b>，因为该模组为游戏引入了多种新机制。,
JWK-FM-Introduction-Maps,"Base package of <b>Freedom Fighters</b> comes with a single scenario for each of the vanilla maps:<br/><br/>- <b>Arland</b>: suggested for new players as an introduction scenario. It requires much less time to complete than Everon, therefore it's a good testing ground to learn the game mode and make mistakes, or test difficulty settings before taking on larger maps.<br/><br/>- <b>Everon</b>: the main scenario, with a large enough map to fully utilize all features and mechanics. Keep in mind it may take weeks or months to complete it!<br/><br/>We intend to publish multiple integrations with outstanding community maps in the future.",《自由战士》基础包为每张原版地图提供一个场景：<br/><br/>- <b>阿兰德（Arland）</b>：推荐给新手玩家作为入门场景。其完成时间远短于Everon，因此是学习游戏模式、允许犯错或在挑战更大地图前测试难度设置的良好练习场。<br/><br/>- <b>埃沃伦（Everon）</b>：主场景，地图足够大以充分利用所有功能和机制。请注意，完成它可能需要数周甚至数月！<br/><br/>我们计划未来发布与优秀社区地图的多种整合内容。,

JWK-FM-LosingSupport-Intro,"Once convinced to support the resistance, civilians will not change their mind on their own. Remember that each supporter can still turn hostile if you give them a good enough reason to. Opposite to supporters, civilians will typically turn hostile immediately in response to your actions. In that case, there is nothing you can do to change their mind except for waiting.",一旦被说服支持抵抗组织，平民不会自行改变主意。但请记住，如果你给他们充分的理由，每个支持者仍可能转而敌对。与支持者相反，平民通常会立即对你的行为做出敌对反应。在这种情况下，除了等待之外，你无法改变他们的想法。,
JWK-FM-MedicalTents-Intro,"Medical tents offer faster regeneration for <b>freedom fighters</b> residing inside. They are also a source for medical items such as bandages or epinephrine, which can be obtained by spending resources at the tent.",医疗帐篷可以为驻扎在其中的<b>自由战士</b>提供更快的生命回复。它们也是获取医疗物品的来源，例如绷带或肾上腺素，可通过在帐篷花费资源获得。,
JWK-FM-MilitaryBases-Control,"In order to take control, the resistance has to win a <b>battle</b> over the base. A <b>battle</b> can be initiated by interacting with the military base flag post.",为了夺取控制权，抵抗组织必须赢得该基地的一场<b>战斗</b>。可以通过与军事基地旗杆互动来发起<b>战斗</b>。,
JWK-FM-MilitaryBases-Intro,"Military bases are the backbone of enemy occupation over the area. All bases need to be controlled by the resistance to achieve victory, but be warned, they are heavily guarded and the enemy won't let control over them easily.",军事基地是敌方占领该区域的支柱。抵抗组织必须控制所有基地才能取得胜利，但请注意，它们防守严密，敌人不会轻易放弃控制权。,
JWK-FM-MilitaryBases-OperatingBase,"Once under resistance control, the military base becomes resistance's <b>operating base</b>, which means the resistance may start construction in it's area. See relevant Field Manual section for more info.",一旦被抵抗组织控制，军事基地将成为抵抗组织的<b>作战基地</b>，意味着抵抗组织可以在其区域内开始建设。更多信息请参见相关的野外手册章节。,
JWK-FM-Missions-Intro,"You can receive missions by talking to the <b>resistance officer</b>. Missions are shared by all ingame players and it does not matter which player takes or reports them. If the mission is awarded with money, the amount is automatically split between all ingame players.<br/><br/>Missions and their progress is, at any stage, fully persistent. It is a good idea to look up the journal upon joining an existing online session to check out if there are any already started missions.",你可以通过与<b>抵抗官员</b>交谈来接收任务。任务由所有游戏内玩家共享，哪个玩家领取或上报任务都无关紧要。如果任务附带金钱奖励，该金额会自动在所有游戏内玩家之间分配。<br/><br/>任务及其进度在任何阶段都是完全持久的。加入现有在线会话时，查看任务日志以了解是否已有任务在进行中，是个好主意。,
JWK-FM-Money-Intro,"<b>Money</b> makes the world go around and it is no different in <b>Freedom Fighters</b>. You will need it to buy gear, supplies, hire subordinates and expand your bases. Amount of possessed money can be checked at any moment by opening the inventory menu.<br/><br/>You can select the currency used in your run during game setup. Selected currency format has no effect on the gameplay and is purely a cosmetic/role-playing change.<br/><br/>Your money is virtual, which means there is no in-game wallet item and your balance is tied to your player profile. What happens with your balance in case of your character death depends on your difficulty settings - ranging from no penalty, through fixed fee, to a complete loss.",<b>金钱</b>推动世界运转，在<b>自由战士</b>中也不例外。你需要金钱购买装备、物资、雇佣下属并扩展你的基地。随时可通过打开物品栏查看所持金额。<br/><br/>在游戏设置中，你可以选择使用的货币类型。所选货币格式不会影响游戏玩法，仅为美观或角色扮演效果。<br/><br/>你的金钱是虚拟的，这意味着游戏中没有钱包物品，你的余额绑定在玩家档案上。角色死亡时余额的处理取决于难度设置——从无惩罚、固定费用到完全失去不等。,
JWK-FM-Money-MethodsOfEarning,"There are multiple ways to make money, but collecting enemy dogtags and turning them in to the resistance is the most rewarding one. You can also sell equipment looted from the enemy.<br/><br/>If you are extremely desperate, you can try extorting defenceless civilians. This should be your last resort, as it turns them hostile against you and makes you lose their hard-earned support.",有多种赚钱方式，但收集敌人身份牌并交给抵抗组织是最有回报的方式。你也可以出售从敌人处掠夺的装备。<br/><br/>如果你极度缺钱，可以尝试勒索无助的平民。但这应作为最后手段，因为它会使平民转为敌对，并导致你失去他们辛苦获得的支持。,
JWK-FM-Money-Transferring,"You can transfer money to another freedom fighter by accessing the radial menu and selecting the <b>Transfer money</b> option. To do so, you need to be in the immediate vicinity of the recipient. After money is sent, the transferee will receive a notification mentioning the sender name and amount of money received.",你可以通过访问环形菜单并选择<b>转账</b>选项，将金钱转给另一名自由战士。为此，你需要在收款人附近。金钱发送后，收款人会收到一条通知，显示发送人姓名和收到的金额。,
JWK-FM-NewGame-Factions,"- <b>player faction</b>: the resistance faction. Irregular forces that will use a mix of their own and allied faction equipment.<br/>- <b>enemy faction</b>: the occupier faction. Regular and organized army, controlling all significant points on the map, with no shortage of assets.<br/>- <b>allied faction</b>: external power that supplies the resistance with political and military aid. Not directly present in the world, but the resistance may have access to some of its weapons and vehicles.<br/>- <b>civilian faction</b>: the local population, present in towns and non-military facilities. Depending on world events, specific characters may become supporters of the resistance or occupier forces and become involved.<br/><br/>Due to many additional features, <b>Freedom Fighters</b> is not automatically compatible with modded factions. In the base version, you can play as <b>FIA</b>, and choose between <b>USA</b> and <b>USSR</b> in allied and occupier faction roles. Support for outstanding community created factions will be added in future.",- <b>玩家阵营</b>：抵抗组织阵营。由不规则部队组成，使用自有及盟军阵营装备。<br/>- <b>敌方阵营</b>：占领军阵营。正规有组织的军队，控制地图上所有重要据点，资源充足。<br/>- <b>盟军阵营</b>：为抵抗组织提供政治和军事援助的外部势力。不会直接出现在世界中，但抵抗组织可能获得部分其武器和车辆。<br/>- <b>平民阵营</b>：本地居民，出现在城镇和非军事设施中。根据世界事件，特定角色可能成为抵抗组织或占领军的支持者并参与其中。<br/><br/>由于许多附加功能，<b>自由战士</b>默认情况下不自动兼容模组阵营。在基础版本中，你可以扮演<b>FIA</b>，并在盟军和占领军阵营中选择<b>USA</b>或<b>USSR</b>。对社区创建的优秀阵营的支持将在未来加入。,
JWK-FM-NewGame-Intro,"Whether you launch via single player scenario, host a local server or set up a dedicated server, new <b>Freedom Fighters</b> game is started using an ingame UI. All three playing methods are supported. Moreover, you can freely switch between single player and a locally hosted server - your campaign progress will carry over seamlessly.",无论是通过单人场景启动、托管本地服务器还是设置专用服务器，新游戏<b>自由战士</b>都通过游戏内UI启动。三种玩法方式均支持。此外，你可以自由切换单人和本地托管服务器——你的战役进度将无缝延续。,
JWK-FM-NewGame-OtherSettings,You can also change the displayed format of the ingame currency to your liking. This is purely a cosmetic feature and has no impact on the actual gameplay mechanics.,你也可以更改游戏内货币显示格式。这纯属美观功能，对实际游戏机制没有影响。,
JWK-FM-NewGame-PreGame,"If there is no saved data present, all joining players will see a <b>pre game</b> screen. If you are playing on a dedicated server, you need to log in as an admin to configure the game and launch it. This is automatic for single players and local hosts.<br/><br/>During pre game you can select faction configuration and multiple difficulty options. <b>Setup and difficulty settings cannot be changed later.</b> Ability to change difficulty settings during a campaign will be added in future.",如果没有存档数据，所有加入玩家将看到<b>游戏前</b>界面。如果在专用服务器上游戏，你需要以管理员身份登录以配置游戏并启动它。单人或本地托管自动完成该操作。<br/><br/>在游戏前界面，你可以选择阵营配置及多种难度选项。<b>设置和难度选项之后无法更改。</b> 在战役中更改难度的功能将于未来加入。,
JWK-FM-OB-CommandPosts-Intro,"Command post enables you to have an <b>resistance officer</b> on site, allowing you to hand in dogtags, take posters or missions in your operating base, without the need to travel to a hideout.",指挥所允许你在现场拥有一名<b>抵抗官员</b>，可在作战基地交付身份牌、领取海报或任务，而无需前往藏身点。,
JWK-FM-OB-Overview-FOBs,"FOBs can be established by resistance members using entrenchment tool, via placement menu. They need to be placed in sufficient distance from enemy controlled facilities, towns and other points of interest. You can use <b>FOB Placement</b> map tool to plan the location in advance.<br/><br/>FOBs are field bases and as such, offer less capabilities than <b>military bases</b>, and their armory and equipment assortment is limited to resistance assets. However, they can be established very early, before resistance is strong enough to overtake a military base, and/or may be placed in very advantageous locations.",前线基地（FOB）可由抵抗成员使用筑防工具通过放置菜单建立。需与敌方控制设施、城镇及其他重点区域保持足够距离。你可以使用<b>FOB放置</b>地图工具提前规划位置。<br/><br/>FOB是野战基地，因此功能不如<b>军事基地</b>齐全，其军械库及装备仅限抵抗组织资产。但它们可在抵抗力量尚未足够夺取军事基地前很早建立，或放置在非常有利的位置。,
JWK-FM-OB-Overview-Intro,"Operating bases are locations in which resistance members can construct buildings and fortifications, store resources, operate garages, repair and refuel vehicles, and more. If enough resources are stored, an operating base may be used as a <b>respawn location</b>.<br/><br/>There are two types of operating bases, as described below.",作战基地是抵抗成员可建造建筑和防御工事、储存资源、操作车库、维修和加油车辆等的地点。如果储存了足够资源，作战基地可用作<b>重生点</b>。<br/><br/>作战基地分为两种类型，如下所述。,
JWK-FM-OB-Overview-MilitaryBases,"<b>Military bases</b> are existing locations in the world, controlled by the enemy. After they are taken over, they can be used as <b>operating bases</b>.<br/><br/>They are somewhat complimentary to <b>FOBs</b>, as they offer more possibilities at the cost of their fixed placement. Fighters will find here regular army equipment of the <b>allied forces</b> and more construction options.",<b>军事基地</b>是世界中已存在且受敌方控制的地点。被占领后，可作为<b>作战基地</b>使用。<br/><br/>它们与<b>FOB</b>互为补充，提供更多可能性，但位置固定。战士们将在此找到<b>盟军</b>的正规军装备及更多建设选项。,
JWK-FM-Ownership-Intro,"Various items in the world can be <b>owned</b> by <b>freedom fighters</b> - such as containers placed in operating bases and vehicles found in the world. The <b>owner</b> can lock the item, restricting other players' access. Both lock state and ownership is persisted. This is useful if you want to keep your personal belongings secure, or make sure no reckless driver hijacks your valuable vehicle at resistance base.",世界中的各种物品可以被<b>拥有</b>的<b>自由战士</b>占有——例如放置在作战基地的容器和世界中的车辆。<b>所有者</b>可以锁定物品，限制其他玩家访问。锁定状态和所有权都会持久保存。这对于保护个人物品安全或防止其他玩家在抵抗基地抢夺贵重车辆非常有用。,
JWK-FM-Ownership-Management,"To acquire ownership over an item, it must have no prior owner. In that case, you will see an <b>Claim ownership</b> action on the item. Just use it to claim the item as your own. If you are placing objects and the object can be owned, you will automatically claim ownership over it.<br/><br/>Sometimes you may also want to pass the ownership to another player, for example if you are building containers for your squad. In that case you can use <b>Abandon ownership</b> action to release the item. Afterwards, it can be claimed by any other player. Abandoning the item will also automatically unlock it.",获取物品所有权的前提是该物品没有现有所有者。此时，你将在物品上看到<b>声明所有权</b>操作，使用它即可将物品声明为自己的。如果你正在放置可拥有的物品，你会自动获得其所有权。<br/><br/>有时你可能想将所有权转交给其他玩家，例如为小队建造容器。这时可使用<b>放弃所有权</b>操作释放物品，之后其他玩家即可声明所有权。放弃物品也会自动解锁它。,
JWK-FM-Phones-Intro,"Phones can be used to make calls to known contacts using the phonebook, or by dialling a number manually. Once phone is interacted with, a radial menu will appear enabling to choose the preferred method.",电话可用于通过电话簿拨打已知联系人，或手动输入号码拨打。与电话互动后，会出现环形菜单，可选择首选拨打方式。,
JWK-FM-Ports-Intro,"Ports can be used to import <b>supplies</b> from abroad, an essential resource representing various commodities essential both for everyday life and development of your facilities. Supplies can be bought for money after interacting with the storage area sign. Each port has a limited storage of supplies, but after a few days the stock should be replenished. Port storages are independent from each other and are refilled independently.<br/><br/>Once supplies are purchased, they will be placed in the pickup area. Don't worry if you can't haul all goods in one go - those supplies are secure and will be waiting for pickup after you return.",港口可用于从海外进口<b>物资</b>，这是日常生活和设施发展所必需的各种资源。在与仓储区域标志互动后，可用金钱购买物资。每个港口的物资存储有限，但几天后库存应会补充。港口仓储相互独立，独立补货。<br/><br/>购买物资后，它们将放置在提货区。如果一次无法全部搬运也无需担心——这些物资是安全的，回去后可继续提取。,
JWK-FM-Posters-Acquiring,Posters can be obtained from resistance officers using relevant dialogue option.,宣传海报可以通过与抵抗军指挥官的对话，并选择相关选项来获得。,
JWK-FM-Posters-GameProgress,"Postering all spots is not required to finish the campaign, but is required to reach 100% completion.",并非所有地点都必须张贴海报才能完成战役，但要达到100%完成度则必须覆盖所有地点。,
JWK-FM-Posters-Intro,"Placing up posters is a very effective early method to raise awareness about your revolution and gain support. It's more time effective than personal agitation, as you can reach many people with a single poster.<br/><br/>There is a trade off however, as the amount of posters - and thus the support you can generate this way - is limited. As the posters are meant to be visible - they are also visible to enemy forces too, and will raise the local threat level.",张贴海报是早期提高革命认知度并获得支持的非常有效的方法。相比个人煽动，它更节省时间，因为一张海报就可以覆盖许多人群。<br/><br/>不过，这有一定的权衡，海报数量有限，因此通过这种方式获得的支持也有限。由于海报需要可见——敌方也能看到它们，并会提高当地的威胁等级。,
JWK-FM-Posters-Placement,"To place a poster, you need to equip it in your left hand (just like any other item). You will see a ghost of the poster in front of you. The ghost color will change to gray if the placement is valid, and yellow if it cannot be placed.<br/><br/>Posters can be only attached to specific objects (usually boards, signs, cabinets, advertising columns and similar), which are marked on your map with a posterable icon. Once an item has been postered, the icon is removed.<br/><br/>Distributing propaganda is a crime, and doing it within enemy sight will make you <b>wanted</b>.",要张贴海报，你需要将其装备在左手（就像其他物品一样）。你会在前方看到海报的虚影。如果可以放置，虚影颜色会变为灰色；如果无法放置，则为黄色。<br/><br/>海报只能附着在特定物体上（通常是公告板、标牌、橱柜、广告柱等），这些物体在地图上会标有可张贴海报图标。一旦物体被张贴海报，图标将被移除。<br/><br/>散发宣传属于犯罪行为，在敌方视线范围内进行会使你成为<b>通缉</b>目标。,
JWK-FM-PublicTransport-Intro,"Public transport can be used to quickly travel around the map. You can use <b>buses</b> to travel on roads and <b>ferries</b> to navigate the water bodies. Every passenger has to buy a ticket each time they travel, price of which depends on the distance traveled. Sometimes certain stops may become temporarily unavailable, for example due to ongoing battles or administrative decisions of the authorities.<br/><br/>To travel, you have to appear as a civilian and cannot be <b>wanted</b>.",公共交通可用于快速在地图上移动。你可以乘坐<b>公交车</b>在道路上行驶，乘坐<b>渡轮</b>穿越水域。每位乘客每次出行都必须购买车票，票价取决于行驶距离。有时某些站点可能暂时无法使用，例如因正在进行的战斗或当局行政决定。<br/><br/>旅行时，你必须以平民身份出现，并且不能处于<b>通缉</b>状态。,
JWK-FM-RadarSites-Control,"Radar sites cannot be captured by the resistance, only neutralized. To do so, the resistance has to destroy all radar dishes present on the site. Even if the defending garrison is cleared without damage to the equipment, the resistance has no qualified crews to operate the installations.",雷达站无法被抵抗组织占领，只能被中立化。为此，抵抗组织必须摧毁站点上的所有雷达天线。即使清理了防守驻军而设备未受损，抵抗组织也没有合格人员操作这些设施。,
JWK-FM-RadarSites-Intro,"Radar sites are operated by the enemy and need to be neutralized to achieve victory. With enemy radar sites in operation, allied forces are not able to provide required support.",雷达站由敌方操作，需要被中立化以取得胜利。在敌方雷达站仍在运行时，盟军无法提供所需支援。,
JWK-FM-RadialMenu-Intro,"Open the radial menu using <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> to access various features specific to Freedom Fighters. This menu is context-aware, which means the options available within the menu may depend on your character state, objects in your vicinity, equipped tools and other. When additional options are available, you will usually see an on-screen prompt in the lower part of your screen.<br/><br/>Basic features available via the radial menu include:<br/><br/>- accessing <b>journal</b>, containing details about your current tasks<br/><br/>- accessing <b>campaign progress</b> menu, which lists your high-level objectives required to win the uprising<br/><br/>- <b>transferring money</b> to nearby <b>freedom fighters</b><br/><br/>- accessing <b>placing</b> and <b>construction</b> menus.","使用 <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> 打开环状菜单以访问《自由战士》的各类功能。该菜单具有上下文感知能力，这意味着可用选项可能取决于角色状态、周围物体、所装备工具等。当有额外选项可用时，你通常会在屏幕下方看到提示。<br/><br/>环状菜单的基本功能包括：<br/><br/>- 访问<b>日志</b>，查看当前任务详情<br/><br/>- 访问<b>战役进度</b>菜单，列出赢得起义所需的高层目标<br/><br/>- 向附近<b>自由战士</b>进行<b>金钱转移</b><br/><br/>- 访问<b>放置</b>和<b>建造</b>菜单",
JWK-FM-Radio-Intro,"You can use any handheld radio to communicate with the resistance. To do so, you must equip the radio in hand and interact with it using the <b>radial menu</b>. You will see a call to action when the interaction is available. Remember to turn the radio on and tune it to required frequency. You also need to be within range of a controlled radio site.",你可以使用任何手持无线电与抵抗组织通信。为此，你必须将无线电装备在手中，并通过<b>环状菜单</b>与其互动。当互动可用时，会出现操作提示。记得开启无线电并调至所需频率，同时需要在受控制无线电站的有效范围内。,
JWK-FM-RadioTowers-Control,"Radio towers are always guarded by an enemy garrison. To take control, the resistance has to simply secure the area by clearing its garrison.",无线电塔始终由敌方驻军守卫。要控制无线电塔，抵抗组织只需通过清除驻军来确保该区域安全。,
JWK-FM-RadioTowers-Intro,"Radio towers are used to enable communication for the controlling faction and jam opposing forces. All radio towers need to be either neutralized or controlled by the resistance to achieve victory. Towers may be destroyed, in which case neither side will control it. This also counts towards campaign progress.",无线电塔用于为控制阵营建立通信，同时干扰敌方力量。为了取得胜利，所有无线电塔都需要被抵抗组织中立化或控制。塔也可能被摧毁，在这种情况下双方都无法控制它。这同样计入战役进度。,
JWK-FM-RaisingSupport-Intro,"Gaining support is a process which takes time. Most actions will not yield immediate result, but will resonate over time instead. For example, if you place posters, it takes some time for them to be noticed. If you donate supplies, it takes some time for the word to spread around, and so on. You can inspect towns on the map to view currently active effects and their expiration time. Once an effect expires, it will stop attracting new supporters and will be removed.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to gain support, including:<br/><br/>- <b>direct agitation</b> by approaching and talking to individual persons<br/><br/>- placing up <b>propaganda posters</b> to increase visibility and awareness<br/><br/>- <b>donating supplies</b> to townsfolk <br/><br/>Some methods are described in detail in their dedicated Field Manual pages.",获取支持是一个需要时间的过程。大多数行动不会立即产生效果，而是会随着时间逐渐发挥作用。例如，张贴海报需要一些时间才能被注意到；捐赠物资后，需要时间让消息传播开来，等等。你可以在地图上查看城镇，以查看当前的有效效果及其到期时间。效果一旦到期，将停止吸引新的支持者并被移除。<br/><br/>获取支持的多种方式包括：<br/><br/>- 通过接近并与个人交谈进行<b>直接煽动</b><br/><br/>- 张贴<b>宣传海报</b>以提高可见性和认知度<br/><br/>- 向城镇居民<b>捐赠物资</b><br/><br/>部分方法在专门的野外手册页面中有详细说明。,
JWK-FM-Recruits-Intro,You can recruit <b>resistance fighters</b> at <b>HQ hideouts</b> existing in the world or <b>living areas</b> constructed by players at the resistance operating bases. Recruited fighters can be <b>commanded</b> as members of your squad.,你可以在世界中的<b>HQ藏身点</b>或玩家在抵抗作战基地建造的<b>居住区</b>招募<b>抵抗战士</b>。招募的战士可以作为你小队成员被<b>指挥</b>。,
JWK-FM-RepairStations-Intro,"Repair stations allow to repair vehicles of relevant category. To repair ground vehicles, build a <b>vehicle maintenance ramp</b>. To repair helicopters, build a <b>service helipad</b>. Follow base game mechanics to carry out the repairs - equip yourself with a wrench and approach the damaged elements until you see a relevant action. The repairs will consume resources stored at the location.",修理站允许维修相应类别的车辆。要维修地面车辆，建造<b>车辆维护坡道</b>；要维修直升机，建造<b>服务直升机停机坪</b>。按照基础游戏机制进行维修——携带扳手并接近受损部件，直到出现相关操作提示。维修将消耗存放在该地点的资源。,
JWK-FM-ResistanceTraders-Intro,"Traders can be found at <b>resistance hideouts</b> and usually offer some interesting and illegal items for purchase. They will also collect enemy dogtags from you, in exchange for money.",商人可在<b>抵抗藏身点</b>找到，通常会出售一些有趣且非法的物品。他们还会收集你的敌方身份牌，并以金钱作为交换。,
JWK-FM-Respawn-Intro,"After joining the fight for the first time, or an unfortunate death, player will be faced with the <b>deployment map tool</b>. In this view, they can select the respawn location they wish to use. If there is no location available, player has to wait until remaining players reenable respawn availability. If there are no remaining players alive, the campaign will fail.",首次加入战斗或遭遇不幸死亡后，玩家将面对<b>部署地图工具</b>。在该界面中，他们可以选择希望使用的重生地点。如果没有可用地点，玩家必须等待其他玩家重新启用重生。如果没有其他玩家存活，战役将失败。,
JWK-FM-Respawn-OperatingBases,"Spawning at <b>operating bases</b> consumes certain amount of resources, depending on the <b>operating base</b> type.

JWK-FM-Respawn-Towns,"To spawn in a town, there must be at least one <b>supporter</b> in local population. By spawning, the player takes control of a civilian character that is taken away from the supporters amount. Town population is not affected by this.<br/><br/>Spawned character will have civilian clothes, a basic handgun, a map and some bag.",要在城镇生成角色，当地人口中至少必须有一名<b>支持者</b>。生成时，玩家将控制一个平民角色，该角色数量从支持者总数中扣除，但不会影响城镇总人口。<br/><br/>生成的角色将穿着平民服装，持有基础手枪、地图和一些背包。,
JWK-FM-Resting-Healing,"Depending on your difficulty settings, resting may heal player characters. Damage is healed in full, independently of the rest duration.",根据你的难度设置，休息可能会为玩家角色恢复生命值。伤害将完全恢复，与休息时长无关。,
JWK-FM-Resting-Intro,"You can use most beds found in the world to <b>rest</b>. Resting advances time, which is useful if you want to skip night-time or, to the contrary, you want to carry out an assault in the dark.<br/><br/>To rest, you have to interact with a bed and select resting duration in the menu. In multiplayer, all players spawned in-world need to get near beds and confirm their readiness to rest. It is not possible to change planned rest duration while players are waiting. To do so, all players must cancel their readiness (or exit resting menu), which will clear currently planned rest.<br/><br/>Once all required players are ready, a timelapse will occur, fast-forwarding by selected duration.",你可以使用世界中大多数床位进行<b>休息</b>。休息会推进时间，这对于跳过夜晚或相反进行夜间突袭非常有用。<br/><br/>要休息，需与床互动并在菜单中选择休息时长。在多人游戏中，所有生成在世界的玩家都需靠近床并确认准备休息。玩家等待期间无法更改计划的休息时长。如需更改，所有玩家必须取消准备（或退出休息菜单），以清除当前计划的休息时间。<br/><br/>当所有必要玩家准备就绪后，将进行时间流逝，快进至所选时长。,
JWK-FM-Resting-Requirements,"Each player needs to have a <b>wristwatch</b> in order to wake up at the planned time.<br/><br/>Additionally:<br/>- character cannot be wanted<br/>- if character is in combat attire, there cannot be enemies nearby<br/>- bed cannot be in illegal area",每位玩家需要拥有一块<b>手表</b>以便按计划时间醒来。<br/><br/>此外：<br/>- 角色不能处于通缉状态<br/>- 如果角色穿着战斗服，附近不能有敌人<br/>- 床不能位于非法区域,
JWK-FM-Saving-Character,"Your character position and inventory is fully saved. On return you will spawn at the same location you have exited, so make sure to exit the game while in a safe location!<br/><br/>If your character dies, their body will be persisted after you disconnect or exit, enabling you to return to it. But if you lose your next character, the previous body will be removed - only the last body is preserved.<br/><br/>Your AI subordinates are saved with your character.

JWK-FM-Saving-Enemies,"Specific enemy characters are not saved, so if you exit the game while surrounded by enemies, they will be gone after you load the game. Garrison compositions are however saved, which means if you attack a place of interest and eliminate a single enemy, that specific character will not automatically reappear. If you clear a location, but do not capture it, it will remain empty after the load - of course, unless enemy reinforcements arrive!<br/><br/>This means that every fight counts and you can effectively clear garrisons by war of attrition, small chunks at a time.",特定敌方角色不会被保存，因此如果在被敌人包围时退出游戏，加载后他们将消失。然而，驻防编成会被保存，这意味着如果你攻击兴趣点并消灭单个敌人，该特定角色不会自动重新出现。如果清理一个地点但未占领，它在加载后仍将为空——当然，除非敌方增援到达！<br/><br/>这意味着每场战斗都至关重要，你可以通过消耗战和逐步清理小规模兵力，有效清理驻防点。,
JWK-FM-Saving-Intro,"Freedom Fighters is a semi-persistent scenario, which means that overall game progress is saved, but not the exact state of the world. Global save is performed periodically every 10 minutes to protect players from losing progress due to a fatal crash, and on every server exit (or closing the game in single player). In multiplayer, the player profile is saved on player disconnect.",《自由战士》是半持久场景，这意味着整体游戏进度会保存，但世界的精确状态不会。全局保存每10分钟进行一次，以防止因致命崩溃而失去进度，并在每次服务器退出（或单人游戏关闭）时保存。在多人游戏中，玩家档案在玩家断开连接时保存。,
JWK-FM-Saving-Vehicles,"Vehicles found in the world are not persistent by default - regardless whether you capture them on the go, or hijack from a parking spot. To preserve a vehicle during save/load, you have to assign it to a parking spot in a <b>garage</b> or a <b>helipad</b> at a controlled <b>operating base</b>.<br/><br/>If you abandon a vehicle in the world and get sufficiently far away, it may be gone once you get back! Assigning the vehicle to a parking spot also prevents this. Additionally, you will be able to recover the vehicle from far away.<br/><br/>Note that claiming <b>ownership</b> of a vehicle does not affect its persistence.",世界中发现的车辆默认不持久——无论你是否即时占有，或从停车点劫取。要在保存/加载中保留车辆，你必须将其分配到受控制<b>作战基地</b>的<b>车库</b>或<b>直升机停机坪</b>停车位。<br/><br/>如果你在世界中弃置车辆并离开足够远，返回时可能已经消失！将车辆分配到停车位也可防止此情况。此外，你可以从远处取回车辆。<br/><br/>注意，声明车辆<b>所有权</b>不会影响其持久性。,
JWK-FM-Shops-Intro,"Various civilian shops can be found in the world, offering diverse assortment of goods. At general shops, you can buy various items intended for tourism, which are also incidentally useful if you plan to conduct guerilla warfare - such as compasses, watches or binoculars. Clothing shops may be useful if you want to get rid of your uniform and blend into the crowd. If you intend to be shot, make sure to visit the pharmacy beforehand.<br/><br/>While item stocks are limited, they usually get replenished before next business day begins. Shops will not want to serve you if you are <b>wanted</b>. Also keep in mind the current time of day - each shop has specific business hours, outside of which you will not be served.",世界中有各种平民商店，提供多样商品。在综合商店，你可以购买旅游用品，这些物品在游击战中也有意外用途——例如指南针、手表或望远镜。服装商店可在你想脱掉制服混入人群时派上用场。如果打算开战，请先访问药店。<br/><br/>虽然商品库存有限，但通常会在下一营业日前补充。若你处于<b>通缉</b>状态，商店不会为你服务。同时注意当前时间——每家商店都有特定营业时间，非营业时间无法购买。,
JWK-FM-Storages-Intro,"Storages are always the first construction to be raised in an operating base. They store resources of different types and make them available to use within a base. Different to base game supply system, resources in <b>Freedom Fighters</b> are not vicinity based and cannot be used directly from trucks and other sources.<br/><br/>As the resources for construction are pulled from the base pool, the first supply storage in a base can be constructed without spending any resources.<br/><br/>Resources in storage are persistent and do not expire or decay.",储物建筑始终是作战基地中最先建造的设施。它们存储不同类型的资源，并使其可在基地内使用。与基础游戏的物资系统不同，<b>自由战士</b>中的资源不依赖于附近环境，不能直接从卡车或其他来源使用。<br/><br/>由于建造所需资源从基地资源池中提取，基地中第一个储物建筑可在不消耗任何资源的情况下建造。<br/><br/>储物中的资源是持久的，不会过期或衰减。,
JWK-FM-StrategyGuide-Intro,"Start by completing the <b>introductory storyline</b>. By the end of it, you should have established your first <b>FOB</b> and learned how to earn money by collecting enemy <b>dogtags</b>, as well as how to raise support by hanging <b>propaganda posters</b>.<br/><br/>Your next priority should be to <b>establish a network of hideouts</b> across all towns. To do this, you need to increase support in each of them. Don’t focus on a single location — instead, spread your efforts: hang posters in town A, donate supplies in town B, move on to town C, and eventually return to A. This rotation helps avoid diminishing returns and keeps the threat level moderately low.<br/><br/>Placing posters and talking to people may not be enough in towns with larger populations. The most effective method is <b>donating supplies</b>, which at this point can be obtained in one of the following ways:<br/>- <b>Purchase with money at ports</b>: Earn money by turning in dogtags, completing resistance missions, or selling loot at shops.<br/>- <b>Raid an enemy factory</b>: Go in guns blazing, or infiltrate undercover and casually drive off with the cargo.<br/>- <b>Ambush enemy transports</b>: Enemy trucks may carry varying amounts of supplies.<br/>- <b>Loot enemy checkpoints</b>: Occasionally, you may find a pile of supplies nearby.<br/><br/>Every new hideout will make your life a little easier — reducing travel time to resupply, pick up posters, or report mission progress. Once your hideouts are established, stock them with supplies, including your <b>HQ</b>. Resupplied hideouts enable the resistance to dispatch fighters who can assist in capturing key points of interest.<br/><br/>In the meantime, consider capturing <b>radio and radar sites</b>, which will help you consolidate your control over territory. This makes traveling safer, as enemy patrols will only appear in zones still under their control.<br/><br/>Now you’re ready to capture an <b>enemy factory</b>. Choose one near your FOB, or establish a new one. Make sure it's stocked with weapons, ammunition, and medical items — either bring them manually or provide enough supplies so they can be purchased from the armory, medical tent, or other facilities. Set up a garage and park at least two vehicles. Whether you’re playing solo or with others, you can also build a living area to command a squad of recruits during the assault.<br/><br/>Proceed to the factory and <b>clear the enemy garrison</b>. You’ll likely face heavy resistance, but you can tackle it in stages. If you’re playing solo, consider using a sniper rifle to harass enemies from a distance, frequently changing position to avoid detection. In other situations, a frontal assault with AI squadmates may be effective.<br/><br/>Once you clear the garrison and enter the factory area, a <b>battle will begin</b>. Thanks to your hideout network, friendly fighters should arrive to help even the odds. If your character is killed, you’ll be able to quickly respawn at your FOB, grab a vehicle, and return to the battle before it’s lost.<br/><br/>Getting supplies becomes much easier once you’ve captured your first factory. It will passively produce new supplies each day, which you can transport to your FOBs, hideouts, or donate to towns. Factories continue production even when you skip time by resting in beds, so you can use this mechanism at moments of downtime. You should now focus on capturing additional factories to maximize your <b>production throughput</b>.<br/><br/>Once you have a steady surplus of supplies, you can start taking over towns and military bases using the same process — ultimately leading to the <b>liberation of all territories</b> and <b>victory in the campaign</b>.",首先完成<b>入门剧情</b>。完成后，你应建立第一个<b>FOB</b>并学会通过收集敌方<b>身份牌</b>赚钱，以及如何通过张贴<b>宣传海报</b>提高支持度。<br/><br/>接下来，你的重点应是<b>在所有城镇建立藏身点网络</b>。为此，你需要提升每个城镇的支持度。不要只专注于单一地点——应分散努力：在A镇张贴海报，在B镇捐赠物资，前往C镇，最终返回A镇。此轮换有助于避免收益递减，并保持威胁水平适中。<br/><br/>在人口较多的城镇，仅靠张贴海报和交谈可能不足。最有效的方法是<b>捐赠物资</b>，此时可通过以下方式获得：<br/>- <b>在港口用金钱购买</b>：通过上缴身份牌、完成抵抗任务或在商店出售战利品赚取金钱。<br/>- <b>突袭敌方工厂</b>：全力开火突入，或潜入伪装悄悄带走货物。<br/>- <b>伏击敌方运输</b>：敌方卡车可能携带不同数量的物资。<br/>- <b>掠夺敌方检查站</b>：偶尔可在附近找到一堆物资。<br/><br/>每新增一个藏身点都会让你的行动更轻松——减少补给、取海报或报告任务进度的路程。一旦藏身点建立，补充物资，包括你的<b>HQ</b>。补给充足的藏身点可让抵抗组织派遣战士协助夺取关键点。<br/><br/>与此同时，可考虑占领<b>无线电和雷达站点</b>，帮助巩固对领土的控制。这使得旅行更安全，因为敌方巡逻仅会出现在仍受其控制的区域。<br/><br/>现在，你已准备好夺取<b>敌方工厂</b>。选择靠近FOB的工厂，或建立新的。确保其储备有武器、弹药和医疗物资——可手动运送，或提供足够物资以便从军械库、医疗帐篷或其他设施购买。建立车库并停放至少两辆车辆。无论单人还是多人游戏，你还可以建造居住区以指挥小队进行突袭。<br/><br/>前往工厂并<b>清除敌方驻防</b>。你可能会遇到激烈抵抗，但可分阶段进行。如果单人游戏，可考虑用狙击步枪远程骚扰敌人，并频繁更换位置以避免被发现。在其他情况下，携AI小队进行正面突击可能更有效。<br/><br/>清除驻防并进入工厂区域后，将开始一场<b>战斗</b>。凭借你的藏身点网络，友军战士应会赶来支援，平衡战局。若角色死亡，可快速在FOB重生，取车返回战场。<br/><br/>一旦夺取首个工厂，补给获取将更容易。工厂每天会被动生产新物资，可运送至FOB、藏身点或捐赠给城镇。即使通过床休息跳过时间，工厂仍会继续生产，可利用此机制度过空闲时间。你现在应关注夺取更多工厂，以最大化<b>生产产量</b>。<br/><br/>当你拥有稳定的物资盈余后，可按相同流程接管城镇和军事基地——最终实现<b>解放所有领土</b>并<b>赢得战役胜利</b>。,
JWK-FM-Tips-AmbulancesMedics,"Passing ambulances may contain significant amounts of medical items, including epinephrine, in their trunks. Medics may also carry epinephrine.",经过的救护车车厢中可能包含大量医疗物资，包括肾上腺素。医护人员也可能携带肾上腺素。,
JWK-FM-Tips-BattleTaxi,"Before trying to capture an enemy base, build a FOB nearby and stock it with resources to respawn there. Place a garage and assign a vehicle that will act as a taxi. Even if your entire squad dies and the vehicle stays left on the battlefield, you will be able to recover it remotely from the FOB. In this manner you will be able to deliver reinforcements sustainably.",在尝试夺取敌方基地前，在附近建立FOB并储备重生所需物资。放置车库并分配一辆车辆作为交通工具。即使整个小队阵亡且车辆留在战场上，你仍可从FOB远程取回。如此，你将能够持续派遣增援。,
JWK-FM-Tips-BloodiedClothes,"Bloodied clothes will make you wanted on sight. If your clothes are bloodied, you will see a hint on the inventory screen.",血迹斑斑的衣服会让你一出现就被通缉。如果你的衣服上有血迹，你将在物品栏界面看到提示。,
JWK-FM-Tips-CallEnemyQrf,"You can use public payphones to report resistance activity and lure the enemy into an ambush, or provoke a battle.",你可以使用公共电话亭报告抵抗活动，引诱敌人入陷阱，或挑起战斗。,
JWK-FM-Tips-CivilianClothes,"You can purchase civilian clothes in a clothing shop. It may be useful to store a few sets at your military base, so you can disguise as a civilian after respawning.",你可以在服装店购买平民衣物。将几套衣服存放在你的军事基地可能会很有用，这样在重生后你可以伪装成平民。,
JWK-FM-Tips-Epinephrine,"Make sure to have at least one dose of epinephrine on you. It can be self-administered if you get downed, which is crucial for lone wolfs.",确保随身携带至少一剂肾上腺素。如果你被击倒，它可以自我注射，对于独行侠来说至关重要。,
JWK-FM-Tips-HideoutsDanger,"The HQ will be shut down and moved to a new location if you endanger it. Any stocked supplies will be lost in the process, wasting the resistance efforts.",如果你危及总部，总部将被关闭并迁移到新地点。任何存储的物资都将丢失，浪费抵抗组织的努力。,
JWK-FM-Tips-HijackEnemyVehicles,"You can capture enemy APCs or helicopters in the early game. Scout the location and ask for distraction at the other side of the enemy compound. Disguise yourself in enemy uniform to enter the illegal zone freely and hijack the vehicle, while everyone's attention is elsewhere.",你可以在游戏早期捕获敌方装甲运兵车（APC）或直升机。先侦查目标位置，然后请求在敌方基地另一侧制造干扰。穿上敌方制服进入非法区域，自由接近并劫持车辆，同时确保其他人注意力集中在别处。,
JWK-FM-Tips-HitAndRun,"Enemy garrisons will usually outnumber you or your group, but don't worry - every attack and every eliminated enemy counts, and eventually you will win the war of attrition. Apply hit & run tactics - approach a base, snipe a few enemies, send a rocket and vanish in the woods. Rinse and repeat.",敌方驻军通常人数多于你或你的队伍，但不要担心——每次攻击，每个被消灭的敌人都是计数的，最终你会赢得消耗战。使用“打了就跑”战术——接近基地，狙击几名敌人，发射火箭然后消失在树林中。重复此操作。,
JWK-FM-Tips-RadioContact,You can use any handheld radio to contact the resistance officer if you are within signal range of a controlled radio site. Remember to tune your radio to correct frequency according to the time table.,如果你在控制的无线电站信号范围内，可以使用任何手持无线电联系抵抗组织指挥官。记得根据时间表将无线电调至正确频率。,
JWK-FM-Tips-StealFactorySupplies,"You can also steal supplies from an enemy factory without capturing it. Likewise, create distraction, drive up in an enemy cargo truck while disguised, load supplies and get away quickly!",你也可以在不占领敌方工厂的情况下偷取物资。同样，可以制造干扰，伪装成敌方身份开着敌方货车载运物资并快速撤离！,
JWK-FM-Tips-StockingHideouts,Make sure to stock your hideouts fully before attempting to capture a town or a military base. The supplies will allow friendlies to take part in the battle.,在尝试占领城镇或军事基地之前，请确保你将据点的物资储备充分。物资将允许友军参与战斗。,
JWK-FM-Tips-WayOut,"Do not get into a fight if you don't have a way out. Situation usually escalates very quickly and you may find yourself surrounded and overwhelmed, even if you had upper hand at the start. Have an exit strategy and don't be afraid to break contact. You can always come later and try again.",如果没有撤退路线，不要轻易进入战斗。局势通常会迅速升级，即使一开始占优势，也可能被包围和压制。制定撤退策略，不要害怕脱离接触。你可以稍后再回来尝试。,
JWK-FM-Towns-Control,"To control a town, the resistance has to have a certain amount of <b>supporters</b> among the town residents. Detailed information is always shown in the town info panel.<br/>Raising support is enough to control <b>villages</b>, but in case of bigger settlements, enemy forces will not stay indifferent. When the town's <b>threat</b> level gets sufficiently high, occupier will attempt to pacify the town and a <b>battle</b> will begin. As a result, the winning side will take control over the town.<br/><br/>Be vary that the resistance will <b>lose control</b> over a town if the population support falls below certain threshold."," 要控制一个城镇,抵抗组织必须在城镇居民中拥有一定数量的<b>支持者</b>。详细信息始终会显示在城镇信息面板中。<br/>提升支持率以控制<b>村庄</b>,但对于更大的城镇,敌军不会袖手旁观。当城镇的<b>威胁</b>等级达到足够高时，占领者将试图平定城镇，并且会爆发一场<b>战斗</b>,最终,胜利的一方将控制该城镇。<br/><br/>请注意,如果民众支持率下降到某个临界值以下,抵抗组织将会<b>失去对城镇的控制</b>",
JWK-FM-Towns-Intro,"Towns are key places for your revolution. Most importantly, they are the home of the local population, which support is desperately needed. Towns come in three sizes: <b>villages</b>, <b>towns</b> and <b>cities</b>, based on the number of residents and their infrastructure.",城镇是革命的关键地点。最重要的是，这里是当地居民的家园，而他们的支持至关重要。城镇根据居民数量和基础设施分为三类：<b>村庄</b>、<b>城镇</b>和<b>城市</b>。,
JWK-FM-Towns-Threat,"Threat level denotes how much trouble the resistance has been recently making. The bigger the threat, the more activity from enemy forces you can expect. Killings, shootings, and even sightings of resistance fighters will rapidly increase threat. Threat will decay over time, so if you are facing too much enemy activity, it is best to change area of operations for some time and come back later.<br/><br/>On the other hand, sometimes you may want to increase threat and provoke a response from the enemy deliberately, for example to contest town control. In this case, some warning shots in the air or an ambush on a random enemy vehicle should be enough. You can also locate nearest <b>phone booth</b> and report resistance activity in the town.",威胁等级表示抵抗组织近期造成的麻烦程度。威胁越高，你可以预期更多敌方活动。杀戮、枪击，甚至抵抗战士的目击都会迅速增加威胁。威胁会随时间衰减，因此如果敌方活动过多，最好暂时更换作战区域，然后再回来。<br/><br/>另一方面，有时你可能希望故意提高威胁以引发敌方反应，例如争夺城镇控制权。这种情况下，在空中开几枪或伏击一辆随机敌方车辆通常足够。你也可以找到最近的 <b>电话亭</b>，报告城镇中的抵抗活动。,
JWK-FM-Undercover-Intro,"By wearing complete enemy uniform your character can go <b>undercover</b>. In this state you can enter illegal areas, openly carry weapons (if the weapon belongs to the enemy faction) and drive enemy vehicles without attracting attention. The cover can be blown if you act suspiciously or open fire.<br/><br/>Depending on your difficulty settings, you will see a status icon when your character is undercover.",穿上敌方全套制服后，你的角色可以<b>卧底</b>。在这种状态下，你可以进入非法区域，公开携带武器（如果该武器属于敌方阵营）并驾驶敌方车辆而不引起注意。如果你行为可疑或开火，你的掩护可能会被揭穿。<br/><br/>根据你的难度设置，当你的角色卧底时，你会看到一个状态图标。,
JWK-FM-VictoryAndDefeat-Defeat,"The resistance will be defeated if no <b>freedom fighter</b> is alive, and there is no <b>respawn location</b> available in the world. This can be caused by lack of resources, lack of population support, being overrun with enemies, or other reasons depending on the <b>respawn location</b> type. Look up <b>Respawn</b> in FM to learn more.",如果世界上没有任何自由战士存活，且没有可用的重生点，抵抗组织将会被击败。这可能由资源不足、人口支持不足、被敌人压制，或根据重生点类型的其他原因导致。请查阅《作战手册》（FM）中的重生章节以了解更多信息。,
JWK-FM-VictoryAndDefeat-GameProgress,"At any point, you can check your campaign progress using the radial menu accessed by <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> and selecting appropriate option. Note that <b>total progress</b> includes optional objectives, not required for <b>victory</b>, therefore it is possible to finish the campaign without reaching 100% completion.","你可以随时通过选择 <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> 并进入相应选项的径向菜单来查看你的战役进度。注意，<b>总进度</b>包括可选目标，而非 <b>胜利</b>所必需，因此有可能在未达到 100% 完成度的情况下完成战役。",
JWK-FM-VictoryAndDefeat-Intro,"<b>Freedom Fighters</b> is an open-world campaign, but not open-ended. There are specific conditions in which your uprising will either achieve <b>victory</b> or <b>defeat</b>. When this happens, the campaign will end and you will have to start all over.",<b>自由战士</b>是一场开放世界的战役，但并非开放结局。存在特定条件决定起义是 <b>胜利</b>还是 <b>失败</b>。发生这种情况时，战役将结束，你必须重新开始。,
JWK-FM-VictoryAndDefeat-Victory,"In order to reach <b>victory</b>, the resistance has to have control over or neutralize all of following points of interest:<br/>- <b>towns</b><br/>- <b>factories</b><br/>- <b>military bases</b><br/>- <b>radio towers</b><br/>- <b>radar sites</b><br/><br/>Only with all of the above the resistance will have enough political and military power to upkeep its rule.",为了达到<b>胜利</b>，抵抗力量必须控制或消除以下所有目标点：<br/>- <b>城镇</b><br/>- <b>工厂</b><br/>- <b>军事基地</b><br/>- <b>无线电塔</b><br/>- <b>雷达站</b><br/><br/>只有拥有以上所有目标点，抵抗力量才有足够的政治和军事力量来维持其统治。,
