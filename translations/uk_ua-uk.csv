JWK-FM-Appearance-Intro,Appearance reflects how your character is perceived by others and depends on all worn attire and held items. Wearing any piece of military clothing will cause your character to be identified as a <b>combatant</b>. This means enemies will shoot on sight and mark you as wanted — the same applies to openly carrying any type of weapon.,,
JWK-FM-Appearance-Settings,"Depending on your difficulty settings, you may see a status icon denoting whether your character is perceived as a combatant.<br/><br/>As the base game does not contain any civilian backpacks, the general purpose military ones are not treated as military equipment.<br/><br/>The absence of a shirt, pants, or boots will cause your character to attract enemy attention. After all, someone running around in only their underwear is bound to look suspicious.",,
JWK-FM-Armories-Intro,"Armories allow to purchase weapons and ammunitions using resources stored at the base.<br/><br/>Different types of armories can be built, depending on the operating base type:<br/><br/>- <b>Allied armory</b> is available at <b>military bases</b> and offers weapons and ammunitions of your supporting faction.<br/><br/>- <b>Field armory</b> is available at <b>FOBs</b> and offers weapons and ammunitions of the player faction.",,
JWK-FM-Battles-Intro,"Battles occur when control over a certain point of interest is contested. When a battle is won, the contesting faction takes control. Refer to the specific location description to learn how to provoke a battle. Only one battle can be active at any given moment and it's progress cannot be saved. If the game is closed during a battle, the battle will need to be started from the beginning. Battles length and intensity depend on the number of players online, campaign progress, location significance and threat level.<br/><br/>Once a battle begins, everyone will see a notification. Progress bar will appear at the top of the screen, accompanied by the location name. Battle location will be also marked on the map, denoting the <b>contested area</b> by a stripe pattern.",,
JWK-FM-Battles-Phases,"Each battle consists of two phases:<br/><br/>- <b>deployment phase</b>: the enemy is still deploying onto the battlefield. The progress bar is yellow and represents how much of their forces are already fielded. Once the bar completes, the battle will transition into domination phase.<br/><br/>- <b>domination phase</b>: the sides fight for control. The progress bar is green and represents resistance control over the location. The control will increase every few moments if there are more <b>freedom fighters</b> in the <b>contested area</b> than enemies in the near vicinity.<br/><br/>If there are no <b>freedom fighters</b> in the contested area, the resistance will begin to rapidly lose control. In this case, the progress bar will turn red. Once the bar fills, the battle will be lost.",,
JWK-FM-BeingWanted-Heat,"<b>Heat level</b> is a measure of how much your character is wanted by the enemy. Once it drops to 0, you will be no longer wanted. Heat decreases over time as long as you stay out of sight of enemy troops. Your current heat level is represented by the fill level of the wanted status icon in the HUD. The time required to fully lose maximum heat depends on your difficulty settings.<br/><br/>If your character dies, the heat level and wanted state does not transfer to your new character.",,
JWK-FM-BeingWanted-Intro,"Various activities may cause your character to become <b>wanted</b>. This means your character is actively hunted by enemy forces and will be shot on sight, even if you appear as a civilian. Being wanted has also many negative side effects, such as:<br/><br/>- civilian shops will not serve you<br/>- resistance representatives may not want to talk to you<br/>- public transport becomes unavailable<br/>- resting becomes unavailable<br/><br/>...and more.",,

JWK-FM-CiviliansOverview-GameProgress,"Population support is required indirectly to finish the campaign. Without it, you won't be able to control all required points of interest. It counts towards the progress, so you need to convince every single person to reach 100%.",,
JWK-FM-CiviliansOverview-Income,Each supporter will donate a small amount of money to the resistance every day. The funds are then split equally and sent to all present <b>freedom fighters</b> automatically.,,
JWK-FM-CiviliansOverview-Intro,"Civilian population is a key element in your revolution. After all, it is their freedom you are fighting for. Just incidentally they also happen to fuel your efforts with money and manpower. Each civilian may have one of the following stances regarding revolution:<br/><br/>- <b>supporting</b>: friendly to the resistance members and disapproving of the occupier.<br/><br/>- <b>neutral</b>: no stance, the initial state for most of the population. They don't really care about the revolution or the occupier forces. They can be turned into supporters, given enough reasons to.<br/><br/>- <b>hostile</b>: actively against the revolution and supporting the occupier. They cannot be turned into supporters, but given enough time they may become neutral.<br/><br/>Population moods will change in reaction to your actions. While civilians are rather tolerant to acts of war and inconveniences caused by combat against the occupier, any wrongdoings towards them will turn them hostile very quickly. Keep in mind your supporters may become hostile just as well, negating your hard-earned friendliness.<br/><br/>You can inspect general population stats in the campaign progress menu. To check local trends, inspect selected town on the map. Population composition is represented by a progress bar, with color-coded segments proportional to the popularity of relevant stance.",,
JWK-FM-Commanding-Intro,"You can command a squad using the vanilla commanding system. You subordinates are persistent and in multiplayer sessions enter and exit the game with you. If your character dies, your squad will become detached. Any player, including you, can take command over a detached fighter by approaching them and using an action. Therefore you can regain command, if you return to your former squad with a new character quickly enough. A detached squad will disappear if there is no one nearby for a certain time.",,
JWK-FM-Construction-Building,"Buildable structures cost resources, which are taken from the location storage. <b>Right now raised structures cannot be moved or removed.</b> Structures belong to the resistance in general and are not linked to the specific person constructing them.",,
JWK-FM-Construction-Intro,"Construction includes placement of various items in the world and building structures. Both these actions are available via <color rgba='226,168,79,255'><action name=""JWK_MainMenu""/></color> <b>radial menu</b>, but will only appear if your character is equipped with an <b>entrenching tool</b>. Moreover, construction is only possible at <b>operating bases</b> controlled by the resistance.",,
JWK-FM-Construction-Placement,"Placeable objects are smaller props that are paid for in money by the placing person. If an item can be owned, it will be automatically linked to the person placing it (for example: item storages). <b>Right now placed items cannot be moved or removed.</b>",,
JWK-FM-DifficultySettings-Intro,"When starting a new game, you can modify various settings to adjust the difficulty and mechanics to your play style. Although these are collectively called difficulty settings, some of the choices are rather a matter of preference. Right now those settings can only be adjusted when starting a new campaign.",,
JWK-FM-DifficultySettings-Presets,"You can quickly change all settings by selecting one of the predefined presets. Selecting a preset does not prevent you from adjusting the settings further - if you change any of the options, the preset selector will automatically switch to <b>Custom</b>, retaining all other settings from the preset. This way you can use any of the presets as a starting point.<br/><br/>If this is your first playthrough, we recommend using <b>Normal</b> preset to experience a balanced gameplay the way it was envisioned.",,
JWK-FM-DonatingSupplies-Intro,"Free stuff is an excellent method to gain supporters, whether you are a politician, or... a politician-to-be. If you win the revolution, of course. The downside is that you actually have to bring the stuff to the table. But here comes the good news - when it's free, nobody will ask you how you got it.<br/><br/>Donating supplies is a rather expensive method, unless you have a surplus of your own production. Supplies are also vital to your own operations, so giving them away in the early stages of the revolution may not be the best choice.<br/><br/>There is no limit as to how many supplies and how often you can donate to a specific town, but many donations over a short period of time will stop having an effect on the support. It's best to diversify and distribute the supplies evenly to many towns in a concurrent manner. Donation effects wear out after some time, so you can come back and donate another shipment later.<br/><br/>Load your vehicle with supplies and drive to the exact location of the town marker, as shown on your map. Come to a full stop once you are within 50 meters from the marker. A prompt should appear, and the donation option will be available in the radial menu.",,

JWK-FM-Factories-Control,"Factories are usually guarded by a enemy forces garrison. Once the garrison is cleared and the area is secured, a battle will follow. Be careful, as during factory working hours civilian workers will be present in the factory area. After repelling enemy forces the resistance will take control over the factory. All factories must be controlled by the resistance in order to achieve victory.",,
JWK-FM-Factories-Intro,"Factories are crucial for your revolution, as they can provide a steady stream of resources, which are much needed for any war efforts.",,
JWK-FM-Factories-ResourceProduction,"Each factory controlled by the resistance will produce certain resources, depending on the factory type. Those resources may be then freely utilized by freedom fighters as deemed fit. On each factory area there is at least one resource storage, in which the produced resources are placed. Those storages are always marked on the map and feature a sign.",,
JWK-FM-FastTravel-Intro,"Fast travel is available only to player controlled operating bases. It is more expensive than public transport, but it can be performed from any location, even far away from roads and infrastructure. You cannot fast travel while being wanted, but you don't have to appear as a civilian.<br/><br/>To use fast travel, you need to open your map and select fast travel icon from the tool picker in the upper-left corner of the screen.",,
JWK-FM-FriendlyFighters-Intro,"Friendly fighters are resistance members or supporting civilians that decided to take part in the fight. They will appear during <b>battles</b> over various points of interest, such as towns, military bases, factories and others. They are autonomous and you cannot directly control them, but they will fight along side you with the enemy. However, their presence depends on your actions, as each fighter needs to be equipped with weapons and ammunition, and that in turn requires <b>supplies</b>.<br/><br/>Friendly fighters consume supplies stored at <b>hideouts</b>. If the location being fought for hosts a hideout - such as a town - then the fighters will appear and take supplies only from that specific hideout. Otherwise - when attacking factories or military bases - the supplies are consumed across all resistance hideouts, including the HQ. Supplies stored at resistance operating bases (FOBs, military bases) and controlled factories are not taken into account.",,

JWK-FM-Hideouts-HqHideouts,"HQ hideouts are established in safer locations — typically in remote houses away from densely populated areas or in small, secluded settlements. They serve as delivery and pickup points for various resistance operations and act as rally points where mercenary fighters can be <b>recruited</b>.<br/><br/>There is always one HQ hideout in the world. However, if you endanger it, it will cease operations and must be relocated. This process may take several hours, during which the HQ will be inaccessible. Any supplies stored there will be lost during the move, so take care to avoid triggering a relocation.<br/><br/>The HQ's location is not automatically revealed on your map. To discover its position, you must either call the HQ using a phone or contact it via radio, and then travel to the coordinates you are given.",,
JWK-FM-Hideouts-Intro,"Hideouts are secure locations used by the resistance for meetings and covert communication. At each hideout, you can meet a <b>resistance officer</b> - your primary contact for all conspiratorial matters. Speak with them to receive new assignments. Keep in mind that they’re not particularly fond of attracting attention from the authorities, so avoid visiting them when you have <b>heat</b> on you.<br/><br/> Hideout officers also offer guns, ammunition, and other war materials - all available in exchange for money.",,
JWK-FM-Hideouts-TownHideouts,"The resistance will establish hideouts in towns and cities once there is enough local support to sustain its operations. Same goes the other way - if you lose too much support, resistance operations will become unsustainable and the hideout will be dissolved. Keeping a network of hideouts is very important, as each additional hideout means more storage space for supplies, which are used to arm your fighters during battles.",,
JWK-FM-IllegalZones-Intro,"There are many areas that are forbidden to enter for civilians. Any players spotted in these areas will be instantly shot and hunted. Depending on your settings, these areas will be marked in red on your map and/or you will see a status icon on your HUD upon entering them.

You can <b>disguise</b> yourself in enemy uniform to walk around freely.",,
JWK-FM-Introduction-Gameplay,"Primary design principle is to keep the gameplay immersive and demanding, while not being extremely punishing for the players. To capture entire map you will need to think strategically. Prepare well and pick your fights wisely, or you will end up in hopeless situations quickly. On the other hand, sudden death because of a stray bullet or unfortunate mortar strike will not set you back by hours of gameplay.<br/><br/>With this in mind, you can get the best out of this game mode by playing it with a chillsim / light role-play attitude.",,

JWK-FM-LosingSupport-Intro,"Once convinced to support the resistance, civilians will not change their mind on their own.

In that case, there is nothing you can do to change their mind except for waiting.",,

It is a good idea to look up the journal upon joining an existing online session to check out if there are any already started missions.",,

Amount of possessed money can be checked at any moment by opening the inventory menu.<br/><br/>You can select the currency used in your run during game setup. Selected currency format has no effect on the gameplay and is purely a cosmetic/role-playing change.<br/><br/>Your money is virtual, which means there is no in-game wallet item and your balance is tied to your player profile. What happens with your balance in case of your character death depends on your difficulty settings - ranging from no penalty, through fixed fee, to a complete loss.",,
JWK-FM-Money-MethodsOfEarning,"There are multiple ways to make money, but collecting enemy dogtags and turning them in to the resistance is the most rewarding one. You can also sell equipment looted from the enemy.<br/><br/>If you are extremely desperate, you can try extorting defenceless civilians. This should be your last resort, as it turns them hostile against you and makes you lose their hard-earned support.",,
JWK-FM-Money-Transferring,"You can transfer money to another freedom fighter by accessing the radial menu and selecting the <b>Transfer money</b> option.

JWK-FM-OB-Overview-FOBs,"FOBs can be established by resistance members using entrenchment tool, via placement menu. They need to be placed in sufficient distance from enemy controlled facilities, towns and other points of interest. You can use <b>FOB Placement</b> map tool to plan the location in advance.<br/><br/>FOBs are field bases and as such, offer less capabilities than <b>military bases</b>, and their armory and equipment assortment is limited to resistance assets. However, they can be established very early, before resistance is strong enough to overtake a military base, and/or may be placed in very advantageous locations.",,
JWK-FM-OB-Overview-Intro,"Operating bases are locations in which resistance members can construct buildings and fortifications, store resources, operate garages, repair and refuel vehicles, and more.

JWK-FM-OB-Overview-MilitaryBases,"<b>Military bases</b> are existing locations in the world, controlled by the enemy.

Fighters will find here regular army equipment of the <b>allied forces</b> and more construction options.",,

JWK-FM-Posters-GameProgress,"Postering all spots is not required to finish the campaign, but is required to reach 100% completion.",,
JWK-FM-Posters-Intro,"Placing up posters is a very effective early method to raise awareness about your revolution and gain support. It's more time effective than personal agitation, as you can reach many people with a single poster.<br/><br/>There is a trade off however, as the amount of posters - and thus the support you can generate this way - is limited. As the posters are meant to be visible - they are also visible to enemy forces too, and will raise the local threat level.",,
JWK-FM-Posters-Placement,"To place a poster, you need to equip it in your left hand (just like any other item). You will see a ghost of the poster in front of you. The ghost color will change to gray if the placement is valid, and yellow if it cannot be placed.<br/><br/>Posters can be only attached to specific objects (usually boards, signs, cabinets, advertising columns and similar), which are marked on your map with a posterable icon. Once an item has been postered, the icon is removed.<br/><br/>Distributing propaganda is a crime, and doing it within enemy sight will make you <b>wanted</b>.",,

Every passenger has to buy a ticket each time they travel, price of which depends on the distance traveled.

This also counts towards campaign progress.",,
JWK-FM-RaisingSupport-Intro,"Gaining support is a process which takes time. Most actions will not yield immediate result, but will resonate over time instead. For example, if you place posters, it takes some time for them to be noticed. If you donate supplies, it takes some time for the word to spread around, and so on. You can inspect towns on the map to view currently active effects and their expiration time. Once an effect expires, it will stop attracting new supporters and will be removed.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to gain support, including:<br/><br/>- <b>direct agitation</b> by approaching and talking to individual persons<br/><br/>- placing up <b>propaganda posters</b> to increase visibility and awareness<br/><br/>- <b>donating supplies</b> to townsfolk <br/><br/>Some methods are described in detail in their dedicated Field Manual pages.",,

JWK-FM-Respawn-Intro,"After joining the fight for the first time, or an unfortunate death, player will be faced with the <b>deployment map tool</b>.

If there are no remaining players alive, the campaign will fail.",,
JWK-FM-Respawn-OperatingBases,"Spawning at <b>operating bases</b> consumes certain amount of resources, depending on the <b>operating base</b> type. Respawn cost, along with available resources at the base, is always shown in the <b>deployment map tool</b>.<br/><br/>Spawned character will have a mix of resistance clothes and no equipment at all.",,
JWK-FM-Respawn-Towns,"To spawn in a town, there must be at least one <b>supporter</b> in local population. By spawning, the player takes control of a civilian character that is taken away from the supporters amount. Town population is not affected by this.<br/><br/>Spawned character will have civilian clothes, a basic handgun, a map and some bag.",,
JWK-FM-Resting-Healing,"Depending on your difficulty settings, resting may heal player characters. Damage is healed in full, independently of the rest duration.",,
JWK-FM-Resting-Intro,"You can use most beds found in the world to <b>rest</b>. Resting advances time, which is useful if you want to skip night-time or, to the contrary, you want to carry out an assault in the dark.<br/><br/>To rest, you have to interact with a bed and select resting duration in the menu. In multiplayer, all players spawned in-world need to get near beds and confirm their readiness to rest. It is not possible to change planned rest duration while players are waiting. To do so, all players must cancel their readiness (or exit resting menu), which will clear currently planned rest.<br/><br/>Once all required players are ready, a timelapse will occur, fast-forwarding by selected duration.",,

JWK-FM-Saving-Character,"Your character position and inventory is fully saved. On return you will spawn at the same location you have exited, so make sure to exit the game while in a safe location!<br/><br/>If your character dies, their body will be persisted after you disconnect or exit, enabling you to return to it. But if you lose your next character, the previous body will be removed - only the last body is preserved.<br/><br/>Your AI subordinates are saved with your character. In multiplayer they will join and leave the server with you.",,
JWK-FM-Saving-Enemies,"Specific enemy characters are not saved, so if you exit the game while surrounded by enemies, they will be gone after you load the game. Garrison compositions are however saved, which means if you attack a place of interest and eliminate a single enemy, that specific character will not automatically reappear. If you clear a location, but do not capture it, it will remain empty after the load - of course, unless enemy reinforcements arrive!<br/><br/>This means that every fight counts and you can effectively clear garrisons by war of attrition, small chunks at a time.",,
JWK-FM-Saving-Intro,"Freedom Fighters is a semi-persistent scenario, which means that overall game progress is saved, but not the exact state of the world. Global save is performed periodically every 10 minutes to protect players from losing progress due to a fatal crash, and on every server exit (or closing the game in single player). In multiplayer, the player profile is saved on player disconnect.",,
JWK-FM-Saving-Vehicles,"Vehicles found in the world are not persistent by default - regardless whether you capture them on the go, or hijack from a parking spot. To preserve a vehicle during save/load, you have to assign it to a parking spot in a <b>garage</b> or a <b>helipad</b> at a controlled <b>operating base</b>.<br/><br/>If you abandon a vehicle in the world and get sufficiently far away, it may be gone once you get back! Assigning the vehicle to a parking spot also prevents this. Additionally, you will be able to recover the vehicle from far away.<br/><br/>Note that claiming <b>ownership</b> of a vehicle does not affect its persistence.",,
JWK-FM-Shops-Intro,"Various civilian shops can be found in the world, offering diverse assortment of goods. At general shops, you can buy various items intended for tourism, which are also incidentally useful if you plan to conduct guerilla warfare - such as compasses, watches or binoculars. Clothing shops may be useful if you want to get rid of your uniform and blend into the crowd. If you intend to be shot, make sure to visit the pharmacy beforehand.<br/><br/>While item stocks are limited, they usually get replenished before next business day begins. Shops will not want to serve you if you are <b>wanted</b>. Also keep in mind the current time of day - each shop has specific business hours, outside of which you will not be served.",,
JWK-FM-Storages-Intro,"Storages are always the first construction to be raised in an operating base. They store resources of different types and make them available to use within a base. Different to base game supply system, resources in <b>Freedom Fighters</b> are not vicinity based and cannot be used directly from trucks and other sources.<br/><br/>As the resources for construction are pulled from the base pool, the first supply storage in a base can be constructed without spending any resources.<br/><br/>Resources in storage are persistent and do not expire or decay.",,
JWK-FM-StrategyGuide-Intro,"Start by completing the <b>introductory storyline</b>. By the end of it, you should have established your first <b>FOB</b> and learned how to earn money by collecting enemy <b>dogtags</b>, as well as how to raise support by hanging <b>propaganda posters</b>.<br/><br/>Your next priority should be to <b>establish a network of hideouts</b> across all towns. To do this, you need to increase support in each of them. Don’t focus on a single location — instead, spread your efforts: hang posters in town A, donate supplies in town B, move on to town C, and eventually return to A. This rotation helps avoid diminishing returns and keeps the threat level moderately low.<br/><br/>Placing posters and talking to people may not be enough in towns with larger populations. The most effective method is <b>donating supplies</b>, which at this point can be obtained in one of the following ways:<br/>- <b>Purchase with money at ports</b>: Earn money by turning in dogtags, completing resistance missions, or selling loot at shops.<br/>- <b>Raid an enemy factory</b>: Go in guns blazing, or infiltrate undercover and casually drive off with the cargo.<br/>- <b>Ambush enemy transports</b>: Enemy trucks may carry varying amounts of supplies.<br/>- <b>Loot enemy checkpoints</b>: Occasionally, you may find a pile of supplies nearby.<br/><br/>Every new hideout will make your life a little easier — reducing travel time to resupply, pick up posters, or report mission progress. Once your hideouts are established, stock them with supplies, including your <b>HQ</b>. Resupplied hideouts enable the resistance to dispatch fighters who can assist in capturing key points of interest.<br/><br/>In the meantime, consider capturing <b>radio and radar sites</b>, which will help you consolidate your control over territory. This makes traveling safer, as enemy patrols will only appear in zones still under their control.<br/><br/>Now you’re ready to capture an <b>enemy factory</b>. Choose one near your FOB, or establish a new one. Make sure it's stocked with weapons, ammunition, and medical items — either bring them manually or provide enough supplies so they can be purchased from the armory, medical tent, or other facilities. Set up a garage and park at least two vehicles. Whether you’re playing solo or with others, you can also build a living area to command a squad of recruits during the assault.<br/><br/>Proceed to the factory and <b>clear the enemy garrison</b>. You’ll likely face heavy resistance, but you can tackle it in stages. If you’re playing solo, consider using a sniper rifle to harass enemies from a distance, frequently changing position to avoid detection. In other situations, a frontal assault with AI squadmates may be effective.<br/><br/>Once you clear the garrison and enter the factory area, a <b>battle will begin</b>. Thanks to your hideout network, friendly fighters should arrive to help even the odds. If your character is killed, you’ll be able to quickly respawn at your FOB, grab a vehicle, and return to the battle before it’s lost.<br/><br/>Getting supplies becomes much easier once you’ve captured your first factory. It will passively produce new supplies each day, which you can transport to your FOBs, hideouts, or donate to towns. Factories continue production even when you skip time by resting in beds, so you can use this mechanism at moments of downtime. You should now focus on capturing additional factories to maximize your <b>production throughput</b>.<br/><br/>Once you have a steady surplus of supplies, you can start taking over towns and military bases using the same process — ultimately leading to the <b>liberation of all territories</b> and <b>victory in the campaign</b>.",,

JWK-FM-Tips-BattleTaxi,"Before trying to capture an enemy base, build a FOB nearby and stock it with resources to respawn there. Place a garage and assign a vehicle that will act as a taxi. Even if your entire squad dies and the vehicle stays left on the battlefield, you will be able to recover it remotely from the FOB. In this manner you will be able to deliver reinforcements sustainably.",,

JWK-FM-Tips-HitAndRun,"Enemy garrisons will usually outnumber you or your group, but don't worry - every attack and every eliminated enemy counts, and eventually you will win the war of attrition.

You can always come later and try again.",,
JWK-FM-Towns-Control,"To control a town, the resistance has to have a certain amount of <b>supporters</b> among the town residents. Detailed information is always shown in the town info panel.<br/>Raising support is enough to control <b>villages</b>, but in case of bigger settlements, enemy forces will not stay indifferent. When the town's <b>threat</b> level gets sufficiently high, occupier will attempt to pacify the town and a <b>battle</b> will begin. As a result, the winning side will take control over the town.<br/><br/>Be vary that the resistance will <b>lose control</b> over a town if the population support falls below certain threshold.",,
JWK-FM-Towns-Intro,"Towns are key places for your revolution. Most importantly, they are the home of the local population, which support is desperately needed. Towns come in three sizes: <b>villages</b>, <b>towns</b> and <b>cities</b>, based on the number of residents and their infrastructure.",,
JWK-FM-Towns-Threat,"Threat level denotes how much trouble the resistance has been recently making. The bigger the threat, the more activity from enemy forces you can expect. Killings, shootings, and even sightings of resistance fighters will rapidly increase threat. Threat will decay over time, so if you are facing too much enemy activity, it is best to change area of operations for some time and come back later.<br/><br/>On the other hand, sometimes you may want to increase threat and provoke a response from the enemy deliberately, for example to contest town control. In this case, some warning shots in the air or an ambush on a random enemy vehicle should be enough. You can also locate nearest <b>phone booth</b> and report resistance activity in the town.",,
JWK-FM-Undercover-Intro,"By wearing complete enemy uniform your character can go <b>undercover</b>. In this state you can enter illegal areas, openly carry weapons (if the weapon belongs to the enemy faction) and drive enemy vehicles without attracting attention.
